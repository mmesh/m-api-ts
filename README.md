# Typescript generated proto packages

Generated code for mmesh client libraries.

This repository contains the generated idiomatic Typescript clients to connect
the web frontend and the mmesh's golang backend fronted by [grpc-gateway][1].

It includes the generated code by [protoc-gen-grpc-gateway-ts][2] necessary for
interacting with mmesh's gRPC APIs.

The sources for the proto files used in this repository:

* [mmesh/m-api][3]: The packages here contain types specifically for
  interacting with mmesh APIs.
